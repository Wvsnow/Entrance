   Programming is fun
   When the work is done
   if you wanna make your work also fun:
           use Python!
   
   Walking down the same old street...
   
   Listening the sound of silcence
   I memory the children time
   when young and be light of heart
   the sky is so blue
   just like the Divus of life
   when wander around the farm track
   grass and unknown wildfollows flow all the yield
